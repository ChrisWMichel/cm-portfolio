      I started learning Laravel in 2015. By 2017, I had built several fullstack
      applications and published them after deploying them to Github. The bigger
      an application is, the more time it takes to maintain them. By 2018, I had
      gotten a job at Orbital Engineering and no long had the time to maintain
      these applications. I have since taken them down as they are antiquated.
      However, these apps are still on Github.

      I'm currently working on a new fullstack application that I plan to deploy
      to Github. I will update this page with the link once it's ready.
