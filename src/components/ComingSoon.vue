        I have several small projects that's just JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and
        other projects that's just Tailwind CSS. I feel that it's more important
        to showcase projects that are more complex and have more moving parts.
        So, when I'm done with a fullstack project, I'll come back here and
        publish the small stuff.
