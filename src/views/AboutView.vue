        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
          When I was young, ambitious, and full of energy, I decided to take
          every programming class McHenry County College had to offer. I told
          myself I was going to conquer them all! By the time I graduated with
          my A.A.S., I had accumulated 118 credits. Ironically, despite all the
          knowledge, I wasn’t proficient in any particular language. This
          experience taught me the importance of focused learning and the skill
          of learning how to learn.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
          In 2007, I decided to move away from Visual Basic as desktop
          applications started to fade with the rise of web applications.
          Determined to adapt, I chose to focus on PHP, JavaScript, and
          HTML/CSS. Over time, I also zeroed in on frameworks like Laravel,
          VueJS, and Tailwind to broaden my expertise.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
          Though I needed to accept diverse roles to sustain my career, my
          proficiency in PHP and JavaScript has been invaluable at Orbital
          Engineering and Sporty’s. However, I am still on the lookout for
          opportunities where I can fully leverage my skills in Laravel and
          VueJS.

          So, if you’re reading this and have a position that fits my criteria,
          let’s create some magic together!

          As a side note, to point out how much time I spend learning, Udemy
          sent me an email letting me know how many minutes I spent in learning
          in 2024.
